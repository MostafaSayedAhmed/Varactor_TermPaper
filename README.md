# Varactor Term Paper
## Project Description
Project is a report about Varactor which is a type of diode whose internal capacitance varies with respect to the reverse voltage. It always works in reverse bias conditions and is a voltage-dependent semiconductor device. Several names know varactor diode as Varicap, Voltcap, Voltage variable capacitance, or Tunning diode. <br />
the paper is written in 2-column, IEEE format. A Latex template for the IEEE journals can be found in Overleaf. 
## Structure:
In varactors the p and n type layers are made of either silicon or gallium arsenide. 
A layer of lightly doped n-type material (cathode layer) is introduced between the
p and n type materials. The main p and n regions are heavily doped as the n-type
layer is called the substrate. The finished diode is put in a carefully designed die
that keeps parasitic resitance to a minimum. 

## Basic idea of operation:
The n-type and p-type materials come together to form a junction, In which at
first electrons got from n to p side and holes go from p to n side which leads to
formation of ions on both sides forming a layer in the middle called depletion
region. This leads to formation of two types of capacitances. The first is called
junction capacitance which is results from the dipole in the transition region. The
second is called the charge storage capacitance. We will only focus on the former. 

## Characteristics:
The capacitance of a varactor depends on doping profile. In an abrupt capacitor
the doping concentration of the cathode layer with respect to distance from the
pn junction is relatively constant while in a hyperabrupt junction, the carrier
concentration in the cathode layer is reduced exponentially as the distance from
the junction increases. In hyperabrupt the capacitance is more sensitive to
voltage changes and gives larger capacitance values than abrupt.
An equivalent circuitc consisting of RC elements can be obtained which will help
us find the total impedance from the whole device. These are obtained to
calculate the quality factor which is a measure of how well the varactor operates.
It is obtained by dividing the energy stored by the energy dissipated in the circuit.
## Applications:
Varactors are used in manufacture of variable frequency oscillators, resonators,
Filters, VCOâ€™s and by extension Audio modulation/output and phase-locked loop.
